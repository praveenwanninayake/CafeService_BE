## About

The **Cafe Management App Backend** is built with **.NET Core** and provides APIs for managing cafes, employees, orders, and more. The backend handles the business logic and communicates with the frontend, which is built using **React**.

## Prerequisites

Before running this application, ensure you have the following tools installed:

- **.NET Core SDK** (8.0)
- **MySQL Server** (relational database system)
- **Postman** (optional, for API testing)

## Dependencies

- `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore`: ^8.0.2
- `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools`: ^8.0.2
- `Pomelo.EntityFrameworkCore.MySql`: ^8.0.2
- `Swashbuckle.AspNetCore`: ^7.0 (for Swagger)


## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

To get started with the backend, first clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/praveenwanninayake/CafeService_BE.git
cd cafe-management-app-backend
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

If you haven't already, install the required **.NET Core** SDK and restore the dependencies:

```bash
dotnet restore
```

### 3. Configure the Database

Ensure that you have a running database (SQL Server or others) and configure the connection string in the `appsettings.json` file:

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Database=cafeprod;User Id=your_user;Password=your_password;"
  }
}
```

Make sure to replace `your_user` and `your_password` with actual database credentials.

### 4. Run Migrations (if applicable)

If you’re using **Entity Framework Core**, run the migrations to set up the database schema:

```bash
dotnet ef database update
```

### 5. Run the Application

Once everything is set up, you can run the backend locally with the following command:

```bash
dotnet run
```

The application will start on `http://localhost:5052` by default.

### 6. Testing the APIs

You can test the backend APIs using **Postman** or any API testing tool. The API routes are defined in the `Controllers` directory.

For example, to access the employee-related API, use the following route:

```
GET http://localhost:5052/api/employees?page=1&items_per_page=10
```

### 7. Swagger UI

Swagger is enabled for API documentation and testing. To view it, open the browser and go to:

```
http://localhost:5052/swagger/index.html
```
### 8. Endpoints Details

Following APIs are exposed as per the requirement.

Please refer API doc for more info:
